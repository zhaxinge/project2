## Gathering via Food

### Introduction

The lack of spending power has led to food deserts, and many regions have been unable to attract investment from big sellers. There are also areas with large amounts of agricultural land, but they are in the midst of a food crisis because of the industrial monocultany and supply chain dependence. The government and many nonprofits are stepping in to bring local ingredients and fresh food back to the population to ensure freshness while reducing traffic pollution and consumption. But Latinos in Piedmont still have their food crisis due to identity and resourse distribution.

####   Bourough level strategy

I look for available public space resources through profiling  ( open space, parks...).,finding opportunities space around and then use phasing ideas like putting units then adding temporary facility then add some permanent facility.

### Part 2:Site Design

<img src="images/food/BLANK.jpg?raw=true"/>
Regarding the shape of the garden, I chose an oval shape instead of a square shape to allow more walkable space for the purpose of maintaining the efficiency of farming and enhancing the movability of the gray space in the middle.

####   Site space strategy
I first divide the site into two parts: food hub, gardens 
<img src="images/food/122.jpg?raw=true"/>
In order to better integrate the site with the current composition of the local families, the garden is divided into three main sections based on the current demographic composition o: a large family community (>4 people per household), a small family community (2-3 people per household; possibly young families or empty nesters) and a dense Latino community that lacks sufficient space for edible gardens, each of which will be provided with land for cultivation of edible gardens.

I mainly use planting to define different garden spaces, for large community gardens I mainly use pleaching trees to provide shade and more undergrowth space, for medium sized communal family gardens I use 3m high hedges to provide shade or fences for more open views, for small family gardens I use 2.5m high hedges to ensure enough privacy while avoiding overly small spaces.

#### Connect Community
By connecting esiting community and plant condition, a wide range of communities can be brought together around for gathering

### Thoughts

When I look back to the project, I find the real pedestrian road environment and field traffic conditions were very different from what was expected, and a more comprehensive data consideration and an accurate scientific screening method were needed to really and accurately make the planned pedestrian system feasible.
